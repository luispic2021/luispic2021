  <h1>Welcome to My Homepage</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Luis — a Senior Product Manager at Disney+, where I lead paid sharing enforcement and growth initiatives at
    global scale.
    I build data-driven products at the intersection of <strong>machine learning, experimentation, and
      monetization</strong>,
    translating detection signals into customer experiences that drive conversion while balancing churn, trust, and
    long-term LTV.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I’m a code-crunching, chart-watching, coffee-fueled force of curiosity. I spend my late nights /
    early mornings and weekends building Python trading bots, integrating APIs, automating daily routines, and pushing
    the limits of what scripting and machine learning can do in real markets.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m also a Montessori dad, a CrossFit comeback kid, and a fierce advocate for my family’s well-being — from decoding
    school applications to hauling mini Goldendoodles across the country, all while planning weekend soup recipes and
    debugging batch files.
  </p>
  <p>
    This blog is where I share my tools, experiments, experiences, and thoughts — from backtesting engines and market
    sentiment checkers to product development best practices and workflow automation hacks.
