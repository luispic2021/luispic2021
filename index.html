  <h1>Welcome to Code & Candlesticks</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Luis — a senior technical product manager at Square, where I build high-integrity fintech systems with precision, purpose, and a hacker’s mindset. I thrive at the intersection of compliance, data, and engineering — leading cross-functional teams to deliver systems that scale securely and efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I’m a code-crunching, chart-watching, coffee-fueled force of curiosity. I spend my late nights / early mornings and weekends building Python trading bots, integrating APIs, automating daily routines, and pushing the limits of what scripting and machine learning can do in real markets.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m also a Montessori dad, a CrossFit comeback kid, and a fierce advocate for my family’s well-being — from decoding school applications to hauling mini Goldendoodles across the country, all while planning weekend soup recipes and debugging batch files.
  </p>
  <p>
    This blog is where I share my tools, experiments, experiences, and thoughts — from backtesting engines and market sentiment checkers to product development best practices and workflow automation hacks.
