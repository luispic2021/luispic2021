## Product Development Lifecycle

Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to build and scale small software development teams. As a **technical product manager**, I rely on **time-tested processes** to ensure smooth software iteration. One of the key aspects of scaling a team is **defining a clear product development lifecycle**. Today, I’ll share my approach to structuring this lifecycle, ensuring that software iterations flow as seamlessly as possible.

## **Understanding the Development Lifecycle**

At its core, the product development lifecycle follows the **Build → Measure → Learn** loop. This iterative process ensures that the product **evolves continuously**:

1. It starts with an **idea (feature request)** or a **bug (unintended behavior or learning)**.
2. The team moves into **development**.
3. The feature undergoes **quality control**:
   - **Automated testing** (unit & integration tests).
   - **User testing** (where applicable).
4. The feature is **deployed**.
5. Bugs or new learnings emerge, restarting the cycle.

A well-defined lifecycle helps teams **minimize bottlenecks** and improve efficiency.

## **Example: Permabot’s Development Lifecycle**

To illustrate this process, let’s look at how I apply these principles to my **Permabot project**:

1. **Feature Ideation** – Every new idea starts as an **Epic** in JIRA, providing a high-level view of the initiative.
2. **Bug Tracking** (Ongoing) – Issues discovered during development or testing are logged as **Bugs**, which are prioritized for an upcoming release.
3. **Development Phase** – Code is written, reviewed, and prepared for testing.
4. **Testing & Validation** – Both **automated and manual testing** ensure that new features and bug fixes meet stability and performance expectations.
5. **Deployment** – The validated update is released into **production**.
6. **Iteration & Continuous Improvement** – Bugs and feature enhancements from the latest deployment are logged, feeding into the next development cycle.

### **JIRA Workflow Example**

Here’s a look at how my JIRA workflow is structured:

Being a **team of one** allows me to keep my workflow simple, yet structured enough to ensure quick iterations while maintaining software stability. One key aspect I’ve found useful is having a **“Won’t Do”** state. Plans change, and keeping an **audit trail** of ideas—along with the reasoning for cancellation—prevents unnecessary churn when those ideas resurface in the future.

Additionally, you’ll notice that **all statuses can transition freely** within the workflow. This flexibility allows tasks to move as needed, avoiding unnecessary process constraints. While some teams may prefer a **strict, linear workflow** with clear handoffs and deliverables between states, I’ve found that overly rigid workflows often make JIRA a blocker rather than an enabler for agile development. Ultimately, the **tool should adapt to the team, not the other way around**.

## **Final Thoughts**
Defining a **clear product development lifecycle** ensures that software teams can scale **efficiently and iteratively**. JIRA workflows play a crucial role in enforcing these processes while keeping development streamlined.
