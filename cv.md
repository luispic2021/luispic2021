## Profile

Technical product leader operating at the intersection of ML experimentation, system design, and AI-assisted development. I design modular Python systems deployed to production, build structured A/B experimentation frameworks, and use LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Goose) to accelerate architecture design, debugging, SQL analysis, and test generation.  

Experienced translating risk signals into scalable decision systems across fintech, compliance, and real-time execution environments.

## AI & Technical Systems

### Automated Trading & Execution Platform (Independent Project | Production Deployed)

Built a modular real-time trading system from scratch integrating Schwab, IBKR, and Massive.io via a unified broker abstraction layer.

- Refactored monolith into structured architecture and deployed to DigitalOcean with automated execution and stop-loss/profit logic.
- Developed pandas-based backtesting engine generating trade logs, PnL, win rate, and Sharpe ratio.
- Programmatically tested parameter variations and productionalized a profitable QQQ strategy based on sustained performance.
- Implemented a v0 Random Forest classifier (80/20 split) using engineered technical indicators; evaluated precision/recall alongside trading metrics.
- Use ChatGPT and Copilot to refactor architecture, generate pytest coverage, debug complex logic, optimize SQL workflows, and evaluate architectural tradeoffs.
